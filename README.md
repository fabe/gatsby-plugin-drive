# gatsby-plugin-drive

Downloads and caches a Google Drive folder that you can then query with `gatsby-source-filesystem`.
Optionally exports Google Docs to a usable format.

## Installation

```bash
yarn add @fs/gatsby-plugin-drive
```

## Usage

In order to use this plugin, you'll need to generate a Google Service Account and share your drive folder with its email. [Here's a guide](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/03/google-spreadsheets-and-javascriptnode-js.html).

```js
// In your gatsby-config.js

plugins: [
  {
    resolve: '@fs/gatsby-plugin-drive',
    options: {
      folderId: 'GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID',
      keyFile: path.resolve(__dirname, 'YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEYFILE.json'),
      destination: path.join(__dirname, 'src/content'),
      exportGDocs: true,
      exportMimeType: 'text/html',
      exportMiddleware: someFunction
    }
  }
]

// Or using environment variables

plugins: [
  {
    resolve: '@fs/gatsby-plugin-drive',
    options: {
      folderId: process.env.GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID,
      key: {
        private_key: process.env.GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY,
        client_email: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL,
      },
      destination: path.join(__dirname, 'src/content'),
      exportGDocs: true,
      exportMimeType: 'text/html',
      exportMiddleware: someFunction
    }
  }
]
```
If the `exportGDocs` option is enabled, all Google Docs in the folder will be exported with the MIME type set in the `exportMimeType` option. You can see a list of available Google Docs export MIME types [here](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/manage-downloads).
If the `exportGDocs` option is disabled, all Google Docs in the folder will be ignored.

The `exportMiddleware` option is optional. If set, the plugin will run each Google Doc through the function, before it writes it to disk.
A usecase for this, could be cleaning up, or manipulating, the HTML that the Google Drive API returns.  
The expected function signature is `Buffer -> Buffer`.

Your drive folder will download all files everytime it builds, except when a file already exists or is cached. To download all files again, set up an npm clean script like:

```json
"clean": "rimraf src/content",
```

## Rate Limiting

The default amount of allowed requests per user per 100 seconds is `1,000`. If you're planning to download a large folder with this plugin, you might have to increase this limit. To do that, open the "Services" tab in the Google Cloud Console, select "Google Drive API" and change the limit under ["Quotas"](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/drive.googleapis.com/quotas).
